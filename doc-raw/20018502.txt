Conners Note regarding all transactions on this report: Filer and his brothers inherited their mother's IRA upon her
death. After completion of probate, the estate's financial advisors liquidated the assets in June 2020. During preparations
for filer's 2020 FD report, it was determined that these 8 transactions totaling $11k should have been reported on a PTR.
soon as this oversight was discovered, this fling was submitted to provide full transparency into that sale.
