Ms. Haas,

 

am writing to correct a mistake that was made on @ Periadic Transaction Report! filed on

September 19, 2014. The amount of transaction for the sale Touchstone Small Cap Core Fund
should be listed as $15,000-$50,000, not $1,000-$15,000.

| apologize for any confusion this may have caused. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Low

John Yarrhuth
Member of Congress
